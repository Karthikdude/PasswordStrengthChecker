# Password Strength Validator

This project is a simple password strength validator implemented in JavaScript. It provides real-time feedback on whether a password meets specific strength criteria.

## Features

- **Length Check**: Verifies if the password has a minimum length of 8 characters.
- **Uppercase Check**: Ensures the presence of at least one uppercase letter.
- **Lowercase Check**: Checks for at least one lowercase letter.
- **Number Check**: Confirms the inclusion of at least one numeric digit.
- **Special Character Check**: Validates the presence of at least one special character (e.g., !, @, #).

## How It Works

When a user types a password, the validator checks it against the defined criteria and updates visual indicators to reflect whether each requirement is met:

- **Length**: At least 8 characters long
- **Uppercase Letter**: Contains at least one uppercase letter
- **Lowercase Letter**: Contains at least one lowercase letter
- **Number**: Contains at least one number
- **Special Character**: Contains at least one special character

## Usage

1. **Include the JavaScript Code**: Integrate the JavaScript code into your HTML file to enable the password validation functionality.

2. **Create HTML Elements**: Ensure your HTML file includes the necessary elements for displaying validation results.

3. **Style the Validation Indicators**: Use CSS to define styles for valid and invalid criteria indicators.

## Example

This project demonstrates how to enhance user security by providing immediate feedback on password strength, encouraging the use of strong passwords to improve overall security.
